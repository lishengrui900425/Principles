Ray Dalio, who grew up a very ordinary middle-class kid from Long Island, started the investment company Bridgewater Associates out of his two-bedroom apartment when he was 26 years old, and build it over the next 42 years into what Fortune magazine assessed to be the fifth most important private company in the U.S. He did that by creating a unique culture - an idea meritocracy [^1] based on radical truth, radical transparency, and believability-weighted decision making — that he believes most people and organizations can use to better achieve their own goals.

Along the way, Dalio became one of the 100  most influential (according to *Time*) and 100 wealthiest (according to *Forbes*) people in the world, and because his unique investment principles changed the industry, *CIO* magazine called him “the Steve Jobs of investing”. (Those principles will be conveyed in his next book, *Economic and Investment Principles*.) He believes that his success isn’t due to anything special about him — it is the result of principles he learned , largely by making mistakes, from which he also believes most people can benefit. 

At 68 years old, Dalio’s primary objective is to pass along these principles in case others find them of value.
